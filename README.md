# AuthenticationSystem
This was a project for my Java class at SNHU. The purpose of the program was to create an authentication system
for employees of a ficticous zoo to log in to. Upon successful login, the user would be shown information pertaining
to their role at the zoo. If the user fails to provide a correct username and password 3 times, the program ends.
